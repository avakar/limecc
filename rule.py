class Rule:
    """Represents a single production rule of a grammar.
    
    Rules are usually written using some sort of BNF-like notation,
    for example, 'list ::= list item' would be a valid rule. A rule
    always has a single non-terminal symbol on the left and a list
    (possibly empty) of arbitrary symbols on the right. The above rule
    would be constructed as follows.
    
    >>> r = Rule('list', ('list', 'item'))
    >>> print r
    'list' = 'list', 'item';
    
    The symbols can be arbitrary objects, not just strings. They must,
    however, be hashable. (Hashability is not enforced by the Rule class
    directly.)
    
    >>> print Rule(0, (1, 2))
    0 = 1, 2;
    
    Occasionaly, you must pass a one-tuple.
    
    >>> print Rule('root', ('list',))
    'root' = 'list';
    
    Note that terminal and non-terminal symbols are written
    using the same syntax -- the differentiation only occurs
    at the grammar level. The symbols standing on the left side of some rule
    are considered non-terminal.
    
    A rule may have no symbols on the right, such rules produce empty strings.
    
    >>> print Rule('e', ())
    'e' = ;
    
    An empty tuple is also the default for the second arguement.
    
    >>> print Rule('e')
    'e' = ;
    
    The left and right symbols can be accessed via 'left' and 'right' members.
    
    >>> r.left, r.right
    ('list', ('list', 'item'))
    
    Every rule has an associated semantic action, which combines data
    from the right-hand-side symbols. The number of arguments
    of this function and the number of symbols on the right plus one must match.
    The first argument is called a context and represents arbitrary data passed to the parser.
    The parameter is usually called 'self' for obvious reasons. The default
    action is the 'pretty_reduce' function.
    
    >>> r.action(None, [], 1)
    ([], 1)
    
    A custom semantic action is associated in constructor. The arguments passed
    to the 'action' callable can usually be modified by the action -- they are
    discarded by the lrparser right after the action is executed.
    
    >>> def concat_list(self, list, item):
    ...     list.append(item)
    ...     return list
    >>> r = Rule('list', ('list', 'item'), action=concat_list)
    >>> r.action(None, [], 1)
